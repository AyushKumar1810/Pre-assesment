## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React 18** - Modern functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, customizable icons
- **ESLint** - Code linting and formatting

## 📋 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### JavaScript Fundamentals
- **Async/Await**: Clean asynchronous code handling
- **Event Loop**: Non-blocking operations with setTimeout
- **ES6+ Features**: Arrow functions, destructuring, template literals
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks and graceful error recovery

### React Best Practices
- **Functional Components**: Modern React patterns with hooks
- **Custom Hooks**: Logic separation and reusability
- **Performance Optimization**: useMemo and useCallback for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **Controlled Components**: Form state management
- **State Management**: useState and useEffect patterns

### TypeScript Integration
- **Interface Definitions**: Strong typing for data structures
- **Props Typing**: Component prop interfaces
- **Generic Types**: Reusable type definitions
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error prevention

## 🎯 Core Features

### Student Management
- Add new students with comprehensive form validation
- Edit existing student information
- View student details in an attractive card layout
- Profile image support with fallback handling

### Course Integration
- Fetch available courses from mock API
- Assign students to courses during enrollment
- Display course information in student profiles

### Search and Filter
- Real-time search across student name, email, and course
- Optimized filtering with useMemo for performance
- Clear visual feedback for search results

### Form Validation
- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Real-time error feedback

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Async/Await Pattern
The application demonstrates proper async/await usage in:
- Course data fetching with error handling
- Form submission with loading states
- Simulated network delays for realistic UX

### Event Loop Demonstration
- `simulateNetworkDelay` function shows non-blocking operations
- setTimeout usage demonstrates callback queue behavior
- Async operations don't block the main thread

### React Optimization
- `useMemo` for expensive filtering operations
- `useCallback` for stable function references
- Custom hooks for logic separation and reusability

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try/catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Graceful degradation for missing data

## 🎨 Design System
